## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello everyone.
  My name is Kenneth Stancil, and I'm currently at Wake Tech studying programming. I am especially proficient in Java and Python, though I have much to learn.
  I would like to go into Android app development or Linux Desktop development in the future.
  My go to operating system is Linux Mint, and I love open-source software in general.
